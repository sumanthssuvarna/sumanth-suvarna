# Questions to solve 

# Certainly! Here are ten Python list-related questions that you can use for practice:

# 1. **Sum of List Elements:** Write a Python function to calculate the sum of all elements in a list.

# 2. **Find the Maximum Value:** Create a function to find the maximum value in a list of numbers without using built-in functions like `max()`.

# 3. **List Reversal:** Write a function to reverse a list without using any built-in list reversal methods.

# 4. **List Comprehension:** Use list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers from an existing list.

# 5. **Remove Duplicates:** Write a function that removes duplicates from a list and returns a new list with unique elements.

# 6. **List Intersection:** Create a function that takes two lists as input and returns a new list containing only the common elements between the two lists.

# 7. **List Slicing:** Given a list, write a function that returns a new list containing only the elements from index 2 to 5 (inclusive).

# 8. **List Sorting:** Create a function that sorts a list of strings in alphabetical order without using built-in sorting functions.

# 9. **List Manipulation:** Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list with each element squared.

# 10. **List Concatenation:** Write a program that concatenates two lists into one and removes any duplicates from the resulting list.
